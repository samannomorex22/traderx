* Pay close attention to the chart patterns of the listed meme coins to gauge their performance and potential.
* Look for charts that exhibit steady upward trends with occasional volatility, indicating healthy growth.
* Avoid coins with erratic or unstable price movements, as they may signal higher risk and potential rug pulls.

## 4. Evaluating Volume and Market Cap

* Assess the 5-minute volume of each coin to determine its trading activity relative to its market capitalization.
* Coins with substantial volume compared to their market cap are often viewed as bullish indicators, suggesting growing investor interest.
* Be cautious of extremely low market cap coins, as they may lack sufficient liquidity and stability, increasing the risk of losses.
