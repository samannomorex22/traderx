Best Pump Fun Trading Strategy

The rise of meme coins has created quite a buzz in the crypto world, and if you’re looking to profit from their unpredictable price swings, this Pump Fun Trading Strategy is an excellent place to start. In this guide, I’ll take you through how to spot tokens ready for a breakout and how to enhance your earnings without succumbing to FOMO.

Let’s dive right in!

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Trading Platform

First things first, we need to use
[BullX](https://t.me/BullxBetaBot)
to start trading Pump Fun meme coins.

and make sure you’re funding your trading account with Solana (SOL) to get started.

Once the deposit is confirmed, you’re ready to move on to the next step.

## Step 2: Using Filters to Spot Promising Tokens

Now it’s time to analyze the tokens on
**Pump Vision**
, a tool that helps filter out promising projects. One key filter I use is based on market cap.

I usually focus on tokens with a market cap of around 6,000, as these tokens have likely attracted some early community or developer interest.

Any token below 6,000 is often just a test deployment, but when you see a token above that level, it shows that the community or developers are backing it.

For example, tokens starting with a 4,000 or 5,000 market cap are still in the testing phase. But when I see a market cap creeping above 6,000, it signals to me that the community or dev team has already started pushing it forward.

At that point, I start looking for those that are approaching the 30K mark to see if there’s potential for a breakout.

Remember to check the security audit of each coin to avoid potential rugs, I usually avoid coins with Top 10 Holders higher than 30%.

## Step 3: Placing Limit Orders

A key part of this strategy is placing limit orders rather than market orders. By using limit orders, you set a target buy price and wait for the token to dip to that level, protecting yourself from bad decisions that could lead to losses.

For example, if a token is trading around 10K, I may place a limit order around 8K or lower, allowing me to buy in at a more favorable price.

Let’s say a token is showing some positive movement, but hasn’t bonded yet. I’d set a limit order at a 20% dip, maybe putting in 0.2 SOL.

If the price drops and the order fills, I’m in at a discount, which increases my potential for profit. I never jump into a token without setting my limits.

## Step 4: Monitoring and Adjusting Orders

As tokens fluctuate, I always keep an eye on the ones I’ve placed orders on. Not all of them will trigger, and that’s okay. The key here is patience. You might miss some tokens that skyrocket before hitting your order, but it’s better to wait for a solid entry than to chase a pump and risk buying at the peak.

For example, I might spot a promising token at 7K market cap, but if it’s too volatile, I won’t risk it. Instead, I’ll keep my limit order at a safe range, like 6K, and if it doesn’t hit, I simply move on to the next opportunity.

## Step 5: Avoiding FOMO and Diversifying

FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) is one of the biggest pitfalls when trading meme coins. It’s easy to see a token skyrocketing and feel like you’re missing out, but remember, there are always new tokens launching. Stick to your plan, set your limits, and don’t chase a moonshot.

Also, diversifying across multiple tokens is a great way to spread your risk. Instead of putting all your capital into one token, I recommend smaller trades on several tokens.

For example, if I find five interesting tokens, I might place small 0.2 SOL limit orders on each. This way, I increase my chances of hitting a winning trade while minimizing potential losses.

## Step 6: When to Sell

Selling is just as important as buying. Once your token hits your desired profit range, don’t hesitate to take profits. A good rule of thumb is to start selling once you’ve made 20–30% gains, or if you feel the token is starting to stall.

Meme coins can be extremely volatile, so it’s important to lock in your profits before the price tanks.

For example, if a token hits 2x your entry price, consider selling half to secure your gains, and then let the rest ride. This way, you’re still in the game but have protected your profits.

Use the

## Step 7: Reviewing and Adjusting the Strategy

Every day brings new opportunities, and not all trades will be winners. But by sticking to this Pump Fun trading strategy for meme coins, you can consistently make profits while avoiding the big losses that come from chasing pumps.

At the end of each day, I review my trades, see what worked, and tweak my filters for the next round. It’s a process, and the more you practice, the better you’ll get.
