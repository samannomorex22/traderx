Make Money DAILY Trading Meme Coins

If you’re looking for a simple way to
*make money trading meme coins*
every day, this guide will walk you through a practical step-by-step process. You can’t talk about cryptocurrency these days without mentioning the impact of meme coins, and with the right approach, you can start with any amount of capital and grow it quickly. Whether you’re new to trading or just need a more efficient strategy, this tutorial covers everything you need to know to start making daily profits trading meme coins.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Trading Tools

First things first, you need the right tools to make your trading efficient and profitable. The core tool we’ll use is a Telegram-based trading bot called
[***Trojan on Solana***](https://t.me/solana_trojanbot?start=r-corokere)
.

This bot allows you to perform trades quickly and even copy-trade from other successful traders, saving you time and effort.

With Trojan on Solana, you’ll have access to features like automatic buying and selling, setting up copy trades, and managing your crypto wallet, and much more.

Secondly, we’ll use
[**SolSqueezer**](https://t.me/solsqueezer_bot?start=0b4e41dfc095)

and
[**Zelfiguru**](https://t.me/zelfiguru_on_solana_bot?start=NjY4NjkwMzExOA==)

to analyze meme coins and find successful traders.

## How to Set Up Trojan on Solana:

1. [**Open Trojan on Solana**](https://t.me/solana_trojanbot?start=r-corokere)
   in Telegram.
2. **Send Solana (SOL)**
   to your Trojan on Solana wallet address to fund your trades.
3. **Use the buy and sell buttons**
   to manually trade meme coins. You can also adjust your slippage and gas fees, but it’s usually best to leave them at default unless you’re more experienced.

## Step 2: Find Profitable Meme Coins to Trade

Now that your trading bot is set up, it’s time to identify meme coins with high potential. To do this, we’ll use a website called
[DEX Screener](https://dexscreener.com/)
combined with other Telegram bots called
[**SolSqueezer**](https://t.me/solsqueezer_bot?start=0b4e41dfc095)

and
[**Zelfiguru**](https://t.me/zelfiguru_on_solana_bot?start=NjY4NjkwMzExOA==)
.

These tools allow you to analyze meme coins and find the best traders to copy trade.

## Steps to Find Good Coins:

1. [**Go to DEX Screener**](https://dexscreener.com/)
   and select the
   *Solana*
   tab to filter meme coins that are traded on Solana (if you are trading Solana meme coins).

**2. Add custom filters**
such as $10,000 Market Cap, Pair Age 4 hours Max, 5M Volume around $15,000 — $20,000.

Here are other DEX Screener filters that you can use:

* [**50K**](https://dexscreener.com/solana/6h?rankBy=volume&order=desc&minLiq=10000&minFdv=50000&maxFdv=20000000&maxAge=2&min24HVol=30000&min5MVol=1000)
* [**100K**](https://dexscreener.com/solana/6h?rankBy=volume&order=desc&minLiq=10000&minFdv=100000&maxFdv=20000000&maxAge=2&min24HVol=30000&min5MVol=1000)
* [**BOTTOMS AND DIPS**](https://dexscreener.com/solana/6h?rankBy=trendingScoreH6&order=desc&minLiq=10000&minFdv=100000&maxFdv=10000000&minAge=2&maxAge=300&min1HTxns=200&min24HVol=300000)
* [**ABOVE 3M**](https://dexscreener.com/?rankBy=trendingScoreH6&order=desc&chainIds=solana&dexIds=raydium&minLiq=10000&minFdv=1000000&min24HVol=3000000)

**3. Look for coins**
with a significant 24-hour price increase and reasonable liquidity. Coins with high price spikes but low liquidity are riskier, as traders may not be able to pull out profits.

Once you find a coin that looks promising, copy its contract address and plug it into the
[**SolSqueezer bot**](https://t.me/solsqueezer_bot?start=0b4e41dfc095)
. This will allow you to analyze the top traders in that coin’s market and decide whether it’s worth copy trading.

After finding the top traders we’ll be using
[Zelfiguru](https://t.me/zelfiguru_on_solana_bot?start=NjY4NjkwMzExOA==)
to analyze each wallet to see if it’s profitable or not to copy trade.

## Step 3: Set Up Copy Trading

Instead of manually buying and selling meme coins all day, you can copy trade from successful traders. This means your bot will automatically mimic the trades of profitable wallets.

Here’s how to set up copy trading with
[Trojan on Solana](https://t.me/solana_trojanbot?start=r-corokere)
.

## How to Set Up Copy Trading:

1. In Trojan on Solana,
   **click on the Copy Trade button**
   .
2. **Add a target wallet**
   by entering the address of a trader you want to follow.
3. Adjust your settings:

* **Buy percentage**
  : Set this to determine what percentage of the trades you’ll copy. For example, if you choose 50%, you’ll buy half of what the trader buys.
* **Max and Min Buy**
  : Set limits on how much Solana you want to trade in each transaction.
* **Total Investment**
  : Set the total amount you’re willing to allocate across all trades.
* Make sure the
  **Copy Sells**
  option is enabled, so your bot sells when the trader sells.

With these settings, your bot will automatically buy and sell based on the trader’s actions, allowing you to earn profits passively.

## Step 4: Analyze Traders Before Copying

Not every trader is profitable, especially in the volatile world of meme coins. To avoid copying bad trades, it’s crucial to analyze the performance of traders before you follow them.

## Key Metrics to Look For:

1. **ROI (Return on Investment)**
   : A higher ROI means the trader has made good profits.
2. **Win Rate**
   : A win rate between 50–80% is usually ideal. Anything too high might mean the trader is planning to dump coins soon.
3. **Trade Duration**
   : Shorter trade duration (around 10–20 minutes) are typical for fast-paced meme coin markets. It’s usually better to find trades that lasts at least 1 hour.

The
[Zelfiguru bot](https://t.me/zelfiguru_on_solana_bot?start=NjY4NjkwMzExOA==)
will give you these details for each trader, helping you filter out bad trades and focus on copying the best-performing wallets.

## Step 5: Fine-Tune and Adjust

Once you’ve set up your copy trading profile, you can always go back and tweak the settings. If you find a trader with a different style that you like better, you can adjust your copy trading percentage, set new max and min buy amounts, and even pause trading if needed.
