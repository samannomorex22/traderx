How To Find 100x Meme Coins Early

Finding the next 100x meme coin early can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. However, with the right tools and strategies, you can greatly increase your chances of spotting these moonshot opportunities. In this tutorial, we’ll break down proven methods to help you find these early gems by tracking insider calls and using multiple trading tools. By the end, you’ll have a clear roadmap for finding those high-potential 100X meme coins before they explode.

## Part 1: Finding Crypto Alpha Calls from Insiders

One of the best ways to stay ahead of the crowd and find 100x meme coins early is by tracking alpha calls from crypto insiders. These are signals or tips from experienced traders or developers who have their finger on the pulse of the market. Here’s how you can get started:

1. **Find Trending Meme Coins:**
   Start by identifying a trending meme coin on DEX Screener from the last two weeks. For example, GIGA is a coin that saw a massive pump. Once you have a coin in mind, copy its contract address.

**2. Use CallAnalyserBot:**
Open Telegram and search for “
[**CallAnalyserBot**](https://t.me/CallAnalyserBot)
.” Paste the contract address of the meme coin into the bot, and hit enter. The bot will then show you a list of Telegram channels that called the coin early.

For example, GIGA was called by the “Maybach Calls” channel, which saw a 2439x return. You can click on their channel to see the original call and check their past performance. CallAnalyserBot also gives you a detailed overview of how well channels have performed in the past. For instance, you’ll see stats like how many 100x or 50x calls they’ve made, giving you a better idea of their reliability.

**3. Join Top-Performing Channels:**
Once you’ve found a channel with solid results, join it! You can also organize all of your alpha channels into folders on Telegram, making it easier to follow calls from multiple sources. This way, you’ll stay up to date with the latest coin calls and won’t miss any important signals.

## Part 2: Organizing Your Meme Coin Alpha for Easy Tracking

The next step is organizing your alpha sources so you can stay ahead of the game. Here’s how you can streamline the process:

1. **Create an Alpha Folder:**
   On Telegram, you can organize all your favorite alpha channels into one folder. To do this, right-click on any chat, add it to a folder, and name the folder “Alpha.” This way, you can easily track all the meme coin calls from trusted channels in one place.

**2. Use Bots to Buy Meme Coins Early:**
After you’ve identified a good meme coin call from your Alpha folder, you can use Telegram bots to make the buying process easier. Bots like
[**Trojan on Solana**](https://t.me/solana_trojanbot?start=r-corokere)
allow you to buy meme coins on Solana faster and secure, without having to juggle multiple wallets.

**3. Check Call Stats:**
Before diving into a new meme coin, use CallAnalyserBot’s “Call Stats” feature to get detailed insights into the channel’s past performance. For example, you can see how many 100x calls a channel has made and whether their recent picks have been successful. This ensures you’re following channels with a proven track record, not just ones doing paid promotions.

## Part 3: Avoiding Paid Promotions and Scams

One of the downsides of meme coins is that many channels may promote coins for paid sponsorships. Larger channels with over 10,000 subscribers may do this to use their audience as liquidity. That’s why it’s important to follow smaller, more consistent alpha channels that are less likely to engage in paid promos.

To avoid getting burned by paid calls:

* **Research the Channel’s History:**
  Scroll through the channel’s past posts and check if their calls are consistent and genuine.
* **Use Judgment:**
  Don’t blindly follow every call. Use your discretion and check the coin’s fundamentals and community before investing.

## Part 4: Using Trading Bots to Buy Meme Coins

Once you’ve got the alpha, the next step is executing your trade. For this, we’ll look at using
[**BullX**](https://t.me/BullxBetaBot)

and
[**Trojan**](https://t.me/solana_trojanbot?start=r-corokere)
trading bots, which are particularly helpful for buying meme coins on blockchains like Solana. These tools automate the process, helping you snipe new coins as soon as they become available and avoid missing out on key opportunities.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to use these tools effectively:

1. [**Set Up BullX**](https://t.me/BullxBetaBot)
   **for Meme Coin Tracking:**
   BullX is a trading bot with a web interface, making it easier to navigate compared to Telegram-based bots. It allows you to track new meme coins and snipe them right as they launch.

A particularly useful feature is “Pump Vision,” which lets you filter through meme coins based on specific parameters like top holders, dev holdings, and whether insiders are involved.

**To use BullX effectively:**

* Paste the Contract Address of the meme coin you wish to buy and check for the security audit.

* Check the dev holdings. Ideally, you want projects where the dev has already sold off their tokens, meaning the community is driving the project, which often leads to strong organic growth.

***Note***
*:*
Even though there’s 1 security issue detected, “Top 10 Holders” shouldn’t be higher than 20%-25% (depending on the coin), so this one looks good.

**2. Using Trojan Bots on Solana:**
[Trojan on Solana](https://t.me/solana_trojanbot?start=r-corokere)
work similarly to BullX but are particularly faster and more effective on the Solana network. Solana has a bustling meme coin scene, and with Trojan on Solana, you can automatically snipe tokens as soon as they hit the market.

[**>> Click here to access Trojan on Solana <<**](https://t.me/solana_trojanbot?start=r-corokere)

Just paste the CA of the meme coin after you’ve checked the security audit and click on the buy button.

Combining

and
[Trojan](https://t.me/solana_trojanbot?start=r-corokere)
bots gives you a powerful one-two punch for spotting and sniping meme coins early on Solana and other chains like Tron and ETH.

**4. Due Diligence Before Buying:**
Before jumping into any project, always take the time to check the coin’s metrics. Tools like
[**Soul Scanner**](http://@soul_scanner_bot)
can give you detailed insights into a token’s top holders, dev wallet, and whether any shady behavior is occurring on-chain.
