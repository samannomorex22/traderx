How to Avoid Scams and Rug Pulls in Crypto

The crypto world can be overwhelming, especially with the constant risk of scams and rug pulls. If you’re new to this, it’s important to know how to avoid scams and rug pulls in crypto to protect your investments. In this guide, I’ll show you practical steps to help identify red flags and stay safe in the fast-paced crypto market.

## **1. Start by Using Trusted Tools Like Dex Screener**

One of the first steps is to use a trusted tool like
[**DEX Screener**](https://dexscreener.com/)
, which helps track various coins and tokens.

This website lets you find new and existing coins to determine if they’re safe to invest in. As soon as you find a coin, you should copy the contract address. This is a key piece of information that can reveal whether the coin is set up for success or disaster.

Copy The Contract Address

## **2. Analyze the Contract Address**

After copying the contract address, the next step is to use a tool like
[**BullX**](https://t.me/BullxBetaBot)
to check the coin’s details.

Paste the contract address into the

, and it will return important information about the coin.

Pay attention to three key things:

* **Mint Function:**
  If the mint function is disabled, that’s a good sign. It means the developer can’t create unlimited new coins, which protects the value of the existing ones.
* **Liquidity Lock:**
  Locked liquidity means the developer can’t withdraw funds, which ensures you can trade the coin freely.
* **No Blacklist:**
  This indicates that no wallets are being restricted from trading, which is a good sign of fair play.

If all three conditions are met, you’ve got green flags. However, that’s just the start.

## **3. Check for Centralization**

One of the biggest red flags in crypto is when a few wallets control most of the supply. You can use a bubble map (often generated by a bot like Trojan on Solana) to visualize how many wallets hold significant amounts of the token.

, paste the contract address and click on the bubbles.

If you see that a small group of wallets holds most of the supply, this indicates centralization.

Centralized tokens give too much power to a small group of holders, who can dump the coin and cause the price to plummet.

## **4. Watch for Red Flags in the Coin’s Activity**

Be cautious of coins that show unusual patterns on the charts, like sudden and sustained price rises without any red candles (which indicate selling pressure). This could mean the price is being manipulated.

You should also check for basic red flags like the absence of a website, social media presence (Telegram, Twitter), or community involvement. If these elements are missing, it’s often a sign that the project isn’t legitimate.

## **5. Watch Out for Bots**

In some cases, scammers use bots to create fake volume and hype around a coin. A coin might look popular, but upon deeper inspection, you’ll find most transactions are done by bots.

This makes it seem like there’s high demand when, in reality, there isn’t. Always cross-check the volume and number of holders with trusted platforms before investing.

## **6. Be Aware of the Mint Function and Sudden Dumps**

One of the most dangerous aspects of a rug pull is when the developer can mint new tokens and dump them on the market all at once. If you find that a coin has an active mint function, the developer can create new tokens whenever they want.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/1*Sp8IRFwL4hvPLTLfffmGAA.png)

This typically results in sudden dumps, where the price crashes because the developer sells off a large supply of new tokens.

## **7. Always Follow the Money**

At the end of the day, the best way to avoid scams and rug pulls is by following the money. Look at how funds are being moved and where the major transactions are happening by using

.

If you see strange patterns or suspect that a single entity controls too much of the coin, it’s a good idea to steer clear.
