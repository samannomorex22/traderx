How to Find Trending 10X Meme Coins

Struggling to find the next big meme coin?

You’re not alone. Every week, many coins explode in value, and most people only hear about them when it’s too late. Here’s the good news: spotting these gems early isn’t rocket science. You just need the right approach and tools.

Let’s break it down.

## Why Meme Coins?

Meme coins like
**ai16z**
and
**Zerebro**
turned early investors into millionaires. The appeal is simple:
**low entry costs, high reward potential, and community-driven hype.**

Now, the goal isn’t to gamble blindly. It’s to identify
**coins with real narratives, strong communities, and momentum**
before they hit the mainstream.

## Step 1: Use DEX Screener and Other Trackers

You can’t find a trending coin without the right tools.
**DEX Screener**
,
[**BullX**](https://t.me/BullxNeoBot)
, and
**CoinMarketCap’s trending page**
are goldmines. Here’s how:

1. **Set Filters on DEX Screener**
   :

* Minimum Market Cap: $300,000
* Maximum Age: 50 hours (the newer, the better)
* Minimum Volume: $2,000,000 in 24 hours

**2. Sort by Volume and Liquidity:**

* High volume means attention.
* Solid liquidity ensures the coin isn’t a rug pull waiting to happen.

**3. Bookmark Coins With Momentum:**

* Check their charts for healthy price action. Look for
  **higher highs and higher lows**
  within the first few days.

## Step 2: Hunt for Narratives

Narratives are the heartbeat of meme coin pumps. AI, gaming, and charity coins are just a few that have taken off recently.

## Real Example: “SPORE”

This AI-driven coin launched with a story about “AI evolving itself.” The concept sounded futuristic and edgy, so it grabbed attention fast. Within 24 hours, it hit $50 million in volume.

## How to Spot These:

* Scroll through
  **Crypto Twitter**
  (more on this in Step 3).
* Search for new trends like “AI Agents” or “Community Coins” popping up in discussions.
* Look for projects that combine
  **new technology with an easy-to-understand meme.**

## Step 3: Watch Social Media Like a Hawk

X and Telegram are
**ground zero**
for meme coin hype.

## X Tips:

* Search hashtags like
  **#AI**
  ,
  **#memecoin**
  , or specific keywords like “Solana meme coins.”
* Follow influencers who frequently post about crypto launches.

## Telegram Communities:

* Join meme coin-specific groups.
* Look for coins that are
  **gaining traction fast**
  or being talked about repeatedly across multiple channels.

## Step 4: Verify the Hype

It’s easy to fall for a flashy coin with tons of buzz. But here’s how you filter out the scams:

**Check the Contract:**
Use
[**BullX Neo**](https://t.me/BullxNeoBot)

to analyze the top holders.

* Avoid coins where one wallet holds over 50% of the supply.
* Look for a healthy distribution among wallets.

**Community Sentiment:**

* Are people excited about the project?
* Is the team transparent and active?

**Red Flags:**

* Promises of unrealistic returns.
* Anonymous teams without verified track records.

## Step 5: Check for Whale Wallet Activity

Following the money is often the fastest way to find conviction plays. Use
[**BullX Neo Wallet Tracker**](https://t.me/BullxNeoBot)
to monitor insider or whale wallets.

## How to Do It:

* [**Get access to over 200 profitable wallets to follow.**](https://t.me/cryptohawktrades/6)
* Track wallets known for profitable trades.
* Look for patterns in their buying behavior.
* Identify if these wallets are
  **accumulating specific meme coins**
  you’re researching.

## Why It Works:

* Whales often have insider knowledge or better resources to identify coins with high potential.
* Spotting their activity early gives you a massive edge.

> ***Example:***
> *If multiple whale wallets are buying a newly launched coin, that’s a strong signal it could 10x soon.*

## Step 6: Timing Your Entry

Even if you find a gem, entering at the wrong time can kill your profits.

Here’s the play:

1. Wait for the initial hype to cool down.
2. Look for a dip near support levels.
3. Use the FIB retracement tool by simply adding it from the top (0 level) to bottom (1 level) and waiting for price to go to the 0.618 or 0.786 levels to enter.

4. Use small test buys to gauge price movement before going in bigger.

> ***Example:***
> *A coin hits $1 million market cap on launch day, then dips to $800,000. That’s often a safer entry point if the volume is still strong.*

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

1. **Chasing Pumps:**

* If a coin’s already up 500%, you’re too late.

**2. Skipping Research:**

* A 5-minute scan of the project’s socials and contract can save you from scams.

**3. Over leveraging:**

* Never risk more than you can afford to lose. Meme coins are speculative.
