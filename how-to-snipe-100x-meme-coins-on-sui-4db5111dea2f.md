## Step-by-Step Guide to Sniping Meme Coins

1. **Monitor New Tokens**
   : Use
   **Dex Screener**
   to keep track of the hottest new tokens. SUI’s volume is growing daily, so don’t miss out on potential 50x or 100x coins by monitoring the
   **New Pairs**
   tab.

**2. Check Liquidity**
: Before buying any token, check its liquidity. You don’t want to get stuck in a coin without enough volume. Avoid tokens with less than $500 in liquidity — this reduces the risk of getting into a rug pull.

**3. Analyze Transaction Activity**
: Check the number of buys and sells. If there are no sells, it could be a scam. Also, ensure there’s a healthy balance between the liquidity pool and market cap to confirm stability.

**4. Use Safe Parameters**
: Add filters in Dex Screener to refine your search. You can set a minimum liquidity of $500 and filter for recent sells within the past hour to ensure you’re buying into a legit project.

**5. Start Sniping**
: Once you’ve spotted a coin,
[**SUIBABot**](https://t.me/suibainu_bot?start=ref_6686903118)

helps you buy it quickly by sending the CA, taking advantage of the low fees and fast transactions on the SUI blockchain.

## Be Cautious of Scams

When sniping meme coins, it’s important to stay safe. A few warning signs to watch for:

* **No liquidity**
  : If a token has less than $100 in liquidity, avoid it.
* **No sells**
  : If nobody’s selling, it might be a honeypot (scam) where you can’t sell your tokens.
* **Quick liquidity removal**
  : If liquidity is suddenly removed, it’s a clear scam.
