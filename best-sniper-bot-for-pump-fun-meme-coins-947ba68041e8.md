Once you’ve got Solana in your wallet and access to
[**BullX**](https://t.me/BullxBetaBot)
, you can start tracking new pairs or using the Pump Vision feature. Pump Vision showcases tokens launching every minute, making it easier to spot potential moonshots.

The platform ranks tokens in three ways: new creations, tokens about to graduate, and tokens that have graduated.

For sniping, focus on new creations or tokens about to graduate. However, be cautious, as tokens often dump after graduation.

# Using Filters for Sniping

BullX provides detailed filters to help you identify the best tokens to snipe. Here are the key filters to set up:

1. **Social Media Presence**
   : Ensure the token has at least one social media account (Twitter, Telegram, etc.). Tokens without a social presence often rug quickly.
2. **Top 10 Holders**
   : The top 10 holders should own less than 15% of the total supply. This reduces the risk of a single entity manipulating the market.
3. **Dev Holdings**
   : The developer should hold less than 5% of the total supply. Higher holdings increase the risk of pump and dump schemes.
4. **Volume**
   : Set a minimum volume of $500 to ensure there’s enough trading activity.

*P.S. Play around with the filters and try to create your own for the best results, the ones above are just an example.*

# Identifying Red Flags

BullX offers in-depth analytics to help you spot red flags. Look for the following indicators:

* **High Top Holder Percentage**
  : If the top holders own a large portion of the supply, it’s a sign of potential manipulation.
* **Insider Holdings**
  : Red indicators show tokens held by insiders. Too many insider holdings can indicate a planned rug pull.
* **Sniper Bots**
  : Yellow indicators denote sniper bots, which can quickly inflate and deflate the token’s value.

# Example Of Sniping a Meme Coin

Here’s a step-by-step example of how to snipe a promising token:

1. **Find a Token**
   : Use the filters to narrow down the list of tokens. Look for ones with increasing holder counts and significant trading volume.
2. **Check for Red Flags**
   : Analyze the token’s holder distribution and insider activity. Avoid tokens with high insider or DEV holdings.
3. **Set Up Your Trade**
   : Configure your snipe settings. Use a low slippage (around 10%) for buying and a higher slippage (up to 25%) for selling to ensure your transactions go through quickly.
4. **Monitor the Trade**
   : Keep an eye on the token’s activity. Look for consistent volume and new holders entering the market.
5. **Execute the Trade**
   : If everything looks good, execute your trade. Consider taking profits early and leaving a “moon bag” in case the token continues to rise.
