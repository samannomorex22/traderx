Here’s how to get started:

1. [**Sign Up for BullX**](https://tron.bullx.io/)
   : When you first sign up, the platform will generate a wallet for you automatically. Save your wallet address and private keys. You’ll need to export these private keys to use your wallet on other devices or apps.
2. **Fund Your Wallet**
   : You can fund your BullX Tron wallet by transferring funds from other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Solana using a service like
   **SimpleSwap**
   or by sending Tron (TRX) from popular exchanges like Binance, MEXC, and Bybit.

## Step 2: Exploring Trending Coins and Trading Tools

Once your wallet is funded, explore the
**Explorer Tab**
on BullX. Here, you can see which coins are trending in the last few minutes, hours, or days, sorted by volume and number of swaps. For example, a coin might gain traction due to a tweet by a notable figure, which can create trading opportunities.

* **Tron Vision**
  : These are the primary platforms for meme coin trading on Tron. SunPump is similar to a launchpad where new coins are first traded, and once they mature, they graduate to SunSwap, Tron’s main decentralized exchange. You can find the best SunPump tokens and track the latest migrations.

* **Real-Time Insights**
  : You can view trading activity in real time, check out holder distributions, and even see how much the top traders and developers are holding or selling. This gives you an edge in assessing the coin’s potential before making a move.

## Step 3: Analyzing Profitable Wallets

One of the best ways to find profitable trading strategies is to study successful traders’ wallets from popular Tron meme coins.

[BullX](https://tron.bullx.io/)
makes this easy with its
**Wallet Analysis**
feature, which provides detailed insights into any wallet’s trading history, profits, and risk management.

1. **Top Trader Insights**
   : Click on a wallet to see its most profitable trades and biggest losses. You can view their trade history, most successful trades, and their risk appetite. For example, a trader who regularly invests and gains with minimal losses is worth watching.

**2. Finding Alpha Wallets**
: Look for traders who have consistent profits across various coins. You can filter wallets by profit, risk level, and other metrics to identify those that align with your trading style.

## Step 4: Setting Up Automated Trading Strategies

BullX allows you to automate your trading strategies, so you don’t have to watch the charts all day. You can set up both buy and sell strategies to minimize losses and secure profits.

* **Stop Loss and Take Profit**
  : Create a stop-loss strategy to automatically sell if a coin drops to a certain level or set a take-profit order to sell portions of your holdings once they hit a target gain.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/1*BVmOP4t2dH8k0Id75WW9wg.png)

* **Limit Orders and DCA**
  : Set limit orders to buy at a certain price or use Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) to slowly enter or exit a position over time. For instance, you can automate buying small amounts every minute for the next 100 minutes.

* **SunPump**
  : The launch platform where new coins start trading.
* **SunSwap**
  : The main exchange where more established coins are traded.
* [**BullX Tron Vision**](https://tron.bullx.io/)
