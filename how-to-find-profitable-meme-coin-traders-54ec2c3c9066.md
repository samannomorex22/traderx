*Note: While you can’t copy past trades, you can observe these traders for future trades.*

## 3. Evaluate Trader Wallets

**What to Look For:**

* Check if the traders bought the tokens (not just sold them).
* Ensure the traders didn’t receive tokens for free (e.g., from a developer).

## 4. Track Wallet Activity

## Important Rules for Copy Trading

1. **Don’t Blindly Copy Trade**

* **Diversify Sources:**
  Follow multiple wallets, not just one, to avoid relying on a single trader’s decisions.
* **Analyze Each Trade:**
  Ensure the trader’s new investments align with your own research.

**2. Beware of Popular Traders**

* **Market Influence:**
  Highly followed traders might trigger market moves, leading to quick buy-sell actions that can affect your timing.

**3. Using Automation**

* **Automated Trading:**
  Analyze and decide which profitable wallets to copy trade using tools like
