comes in. This guide will break down how to use this powerful tool to snipe meme coins as they launch, giving you a chance to secure those early gains before the hype takes over.

Let’s get started and level up your trading strategy!

## What You’ll Need

Before we dive into the process, here are the essentials:

1. [**Trojan on Solana Bot**](https://t.me/solana_trojanbot?start=r-corokere)
   : A free trading bot designed for Solana traders.
2. **Solana Wallet**
   : Ensure you have enough SOL in your wallet (at least 1 SOL per snipe is recommended).
3. **Pump.Fun tokens:**
   Find tokens before they migrate on platforms like
   [**BullX**](https://t.me/BullxBetaBot)

   or
   [**GMGN**](https://gmgn.ai/?ref=cryptohawk&chain=sol)
   .
4. **A Quick Setup**
   : Speed is critical for sniping. We’ll set up the bot to maximize your chances of success.

## How To Use Trojan Bot Sniper

## 1. Set Up Trojan Bot

* [**Start by accessing Trojan Bot here**](https://t.me/solana_trojanbot?start=r-corokere)
  and get early access to the new sniper.
* Press
  **Start**
  , which will bring you to the bot’s main settings page.
* Use one of the
  **backup bots**
  to ensure a smoother experience. Bots with green indicators are less congested and perform faster (best for sniping).

## 2. Adjust Settings for Sniping

* **Gas Settings**
  : Select the fastest gas option, like the “
  **Turbo**
  ” setting, to ensure your transactions process quickly.

* **MEV Protection**
  : Decide whether to enable this. While it provides additional security, it can slow transactions. If you rarely face MEV issues, it’s best to leave it off for faster execution.

* **Auto-Sell Settings**
  : Set up your stop-loss and take-profit parameters:

**— Stop-Loss**
: 55% below your entry price.

**— Take-Profit**
: 55% above your entry price, selling 95% of your holdings to lock in profits while keeping 5% as a moon bag.

* **Slippage**
  : Adjust to 15–25% to ensure smoother transactions during high volatility.

**NOTE:**

If multiple profiles are enabled for the same function (ex. swaps), the profile listed first will always have priority — make sure you delete the default profile and only keep the sniper profile turned on.

## 3. Find Coins to Snipe

* Use platforms like
  [**BullX**](https://t.me/BullxBetaBot)

  or
  [**GMGN**](https://gmgn.ai/?ref=cryptohawk&chain=sol)

  to track meme coins preparing to launch or migrate to Raydium.

GMGN

Focus on coins that:

* Have been listed on Pump.fun for at least 2–3 hours.
* Show a healthy holder distribution (avoid coins where top holders control more than 50%).
* Have solid metrics like dev transparency and no history of rug pulls.

## 4. Set Up Sniper Mode

* Go to the
  **Sniper**
  section in
  [**Trojan Bot**](https://t.me/solana_trojanbot?start=r-corokere)

* Set priority fees to give your transactions an edge over other snipers (I usually use 0.02 SOL).

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/1*-w0-0-HTjGDud6f68qroCg.png)

* Turn on/off custom MEV protection (
  **ON**
  = safer but slower,
  **OFF**
  = riskier but faster)

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/1*EC1_Mbiwnwa10pITkN5CTw.png)

* Click on
  **+Add**
  and input the coin’s token address, set your desired SOL amount for the trade, and your slippage.

  **+ Create**
  and everything is ready.

## 5. Execute the Trade

* Once the bot is ready, it will monitor the liquidity addition and execute the trade as soon as the coin launches.
* Check your wallet to confirm the transaction and monitor the coin’s performance.

## 6. Monitor and Adjust

* Keep an eye on the coin’s price action.
  [Trojan Bot](https://t.me/solana_trojanbot?start=r-corokere)
  will execute your auto-sell settings, but you can manually intervene if needed.
* If a coin begins to crash, your stop-loss will protect you. If it goes up fast, you’ll lock in profits and retain a small moon bag for potential long-term gains.

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**
   : Begin with a modest amount (1–5 SOL) until you’re comfortable with the process.
2. **Timing Matters**
   : The best coins often launch during active trading hours. Late-night launches may have less competition but can also be riskier.
3. **Avoid FOMO**
   : Don’t rush into every coin. Analyze metrics and focus on coins with potential.
