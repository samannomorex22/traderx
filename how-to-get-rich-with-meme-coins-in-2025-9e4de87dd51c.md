* **Unique Branding**

* **Community Activity**
  : A buzzing Telegram or Discord is a strong sign of an engaged community ready to pump the coin.

* **Checklist for Scams**
  :

— Has the project’s Twitter handle been reused?

— Is the contract address unique?

— Does the liquidity look legit?

## Step 3: The Strategies That Work

Let’s get to the juicy part — how to actually trade and make money.

## 1. Ride the Narrative

Meme coins explode when they latch onto trending narratives. Stay updated with:

* BullX Explore page

* Crypto Twitter (track accounts like Elon Musk’s)
* News events (e.g., pop culture moments, tech breakthroughs, AI)
* TikTok and Instagram trends

Do this daily when you wake up and see what narrative is playing.

When a coin aligns with a hot narrative, jump in early and exit before the hype fades.

## 2. Scalping for Small Wins

The goal isn’t always a 100x. Sometimes, it’s about stacking smaller, consistent wins:

* Enter when you see whales buying.
* Exit when you’ve made 20–50% profit, not when the whales are selling.
* Don’t get greedy. Take profits fast.

Imagine you enter with 10 SOL each time and exit with 2–5 SOL in profit.

If you do this 10x times, you already made lots of money by simply taking profit early.

## 3. Master Wallet Tracking

Track these wallets:

* **Top Traders**
  : Watch where the pros are putting their money.

* **Devs’ Wallets**
  : If a developer’s last project hit $50M, their next coin is worth watching.

* **Community Favorites**
  : Certain wallets consistently trade “fan favorite” meme coins.

## 4. Follow The Pump-and-Dump Patterns

Here’s the cold truth: most meme coins follow predictable pump-and-dump cycles. Your job? Enter early and exit before the dump.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/1*4GmzJvo1I_42xALmuxIFYA.png)

* Enter below $100K market cap.
* Exit between $500K and $1M market cap.
* Never hold too long. It’s better to sell early than lose everything.

## Avoiding Common Mistakes

Let’s save you from blowing your money:

* **Don’t Buy Blind**
  : Always check the Twitter, Telegram, and contract details.
* **Avoid Reused Projects**
  : If a coin’s social media or branding has been reused, it’s likely a scam.
* **Steer Clear of “Honeypots”**
  : These are coins that let you buy but not sell. Tools like
  [**BullX**](https://t.me/BullxNeoBot)

  can flag these scams.
* **Stay Disciplined**
  : FOMO (fear of missing out) kills profits. Stick to your plan.

## Example: A Winning Meme Coin Trade

Last year, traders spotted a meme coin inspired by Elon Musk’s Twitter name change called “Kekius Maximus”.

Early buyers at a $20K market cap saw it skyrocket to $25M in hours. Smart traders exited at $15M, pocketing massive gains.

The lesson? Catch trends early, ride the wave, and exit before the hype crashes.

## The Bigger Picture

This isn’t about luck. It’s about putting in the work:

* Spend hours scanning charts and wallets.
* Stay online to catch breaking trends.
* Join groups, collaborate, and learn from others.
* Build a process, refine it, and stick to it.

Meme coin trading is a skill. The more you practice, the better you get.
