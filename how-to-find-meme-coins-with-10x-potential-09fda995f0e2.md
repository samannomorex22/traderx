How To Find 10X Meme Coins

Are you tired of buying meme coins that never seem to take off, only to watch others skyrocket while you miss out? Believe it or not, it’s not just luck — there are simple strategies you can use to
*find meme coins with 10x potential*
. While not every coin will deliver huge returns, applying a consistent system can help you spot promising ones. If you stick to a method and spread your investments across a few coins, you might just hit a winner, especially in a booming crypto market.

## Step 1: Where to Find Meme Coins

The first question everyone asks is, “Where do I find these meme coins?” One of the best tools for this is
[**DEX Screener**](https://dexscreener.com/)
. It’s a great place to see which coins are trending in real-time.

On the top left of the dashboard, you can sort coins by time frames like 5 minutes, 1 hour, or even 6 hours.

Let’s say you’re looking for Solana-based meme coins — you can add a filter to only show those. Ethereum-based coins are also an option if you prefer. By sorting these coins by time frames, you’ll see which ones are gaining momentum, and many of them are brand new!

Another cool tool is
[**Banter Bubbles**](https://web.banterbubbles.com/)
, which visually represents the meme coin market. You can adjust the time frames and see which coins are moving. Write down a few names of meme coins that stand out — let’s say “Pork,” “CAT,” or “RGOAT.”

Additionally, you can use

to assess whether the coin is worth investing in by analyzing factors such as top holders’ distribution, security, and even setting custom take-profit and stop-loss orders.

Now you’re ready to move on to the charts.

## Step 2: Analyze Meme Coin Charts

Once you’ve got a list of potential coins, you need to do some basic research. Pull up the charts and ask yourself: is the coin bouncing off support levels? Has it broken out of a downtrend?

For instance, a coin like “MUMU” might have been struggling in a downtrend for months, but now it’s hitting support and starting to rise.

To decide if it’s worth investing in, one thing to check is whether the coin is outperforming Solana or Ethereum (depending on the base currency). If the coin is rising faster than the main crypto, that’s a good sign.

Also, look out for volume. You want to see increased trading volume as the price goes up, which shows that people are buying.

## Step 3: Managing Risk

Risk management is key. As you analyze the charts, you need to decide at what price point you’ll exit if the coin drops. Set your stop-loss levels — this way, if the market turns against you, you won’t lose everything.

Let’s say the coin is at $90 million in market cap, and you decide to set your stop-loss at $70 million. If it drops, you take a small loss and protect your account.

Avoid the common mistake of holding onto a meme coin and hoping it’ll rebound after a massive drop. Trading meme coins isn’t about luck or holding long-term; it’s about having a clear plan and knowing when to exit if things go wrong.

## Step 4: Follow the Volume

Volume is the fuel for meme coins. If you’re seeing large amounts of trading volume combined with price increases, that’s a very bullish sign. On the flip side, if a coin’s price is going up but volume is low, it might be a temporary pump that could reverse.

For example, let’s say a meme coin like “Billy” has surged from $15 million to $50 million in just a few days, supported by rising volume — that’s exactly the kind of momentum you want to get in on early.

## Step 5: Look for Breakout Patterns

Another thing to watch for is
**breakout patterns**
. Sometimes a meme coin will be stuck in a sideways consolidation phase, where the price hovers within a certain range. If the coin finally breaks out of this range with high volume, it could be the start of a major rally.

A pattern like an ascending triangle — where the price forms higher lows but hits the same resistance level — can signal an explosive breakout. If you spot this, it might be time to enter a position.

## Step 6: Macro Factors

Finally, always keep an eye on the broader crypto market. Meme coins tend to perform best when larger cryptos like Bitcoin or Solana are trending sideways or upward.

If the overall market is in a downtrend, even the best meme coins are unlikely to break out.
