Find Legit Projects On Solana

Are you looking to navigate the world of Solana blockchain projects but want to ensure you‚Äôre investing in legitimate projects? This guide will equip you with simple yet effective methods to distinguish between scam and legit projects on Solana.

Let‚Äôs dive in and explore how you can make informed decisions when exploring new investment opportunities.

## Key Strategies to Identify Legit Projects On Solana

## 1. Evaluate Token Distribution

* Use tools like
  [**Birdeye**](https://birdeye.so/)
  ,
  [**Dex Screener**](https://dexscreener.com/)
  and
  [**RugCheck**](https://rugcheck.xyz/)
  .
* Begin by examining the distribution of tokens among the top holders of the project.
* Ensure that no single wallet or small group of wallets holds an excessively large percentage of the total token supply.
* A rule of thumb is to verify that the top 10 wallets do not collectively hold more than 3% of the total token supply.
* If you notice a concentration of ownership among a few wallets, it could be a red flag indicating potential manipulation.

## 2. Check Security Measures

* Delve into the security features of the project to assess its vulnerability to manipulation.
* Look for indicators such as whether the token is mintable, mutable, or if ownership has been renounced.
* A token that is mintable and mutable poses a higher risk as the creator could mint additional tokens, manipulate the market, and potentially exit scam.
* On the other hand, tokens with security measures such as non-mintability, immutability, and renounced ownership provide greater assurance of trustworthiness.
