So, what exactly is an insider? Insiders are simply individuals who gain information earlier than the general public. They might be project developers, influential people with large audiences, or those with key connections. By finding their wallets, you can leverage their moves without doing all the hard work yourself.

Let’s dive into how to spot these wallets and make the most of them!

**2. Check Top Traders:**
Go to the “
**Top Traders**
” section and focus on wallets with a manageable number of transactions. For example, avoid those with too many transactions as they might be high-risk or too complex to follow.

**3. Analyze Transactions:**
Review each transaction to determine the buying and selling patterns. Some wallets may buy early but hold their assets, signaling insider information or a strategy you could mimic.

## Analyzing Wallets and Their Strategies

Once you’ve identified a potential insider wallet, dig deeper into their transaction history. Look for patterns like repeated early buys without immediate sales, which may indicate long-term confidence in a project.

* **Use Blockchain Explorers:**
  You can further explore a wallet using blockchain explorers like Solscan or Tronscan. Copy the wallet address, paste it into the explorer, and you can see all past and current transactions.
* **Use Zelfiguru:**
  You can simply your work and dig even deeper by using
  [**Zelfiguru Telegram bot**](https://t.me/zelfiguru_on_solana_bot?start=NjY4NjkwMzExOA==)
  to analyze the wallet’s transactions and see its ROI, top coins, win rate, etc.

* **Check Unrealized Gains:**
  Focus on wallets showing large unrealized gains. For instance, if you see a wallet with four transactions and a $92,000 unrealized gain, that’s a good sign they bought early and might have insider information.

## Avoiding Common Mistakes

While it might be tempting to copy every move you see, it’s crucial to analyze each wallet thoroughly. Avoid blindly following wallets with erratic trading patterns or those that make heavy use of sniping techniques (buying and selling at lightning speed).

1. **Check for Snipers:**
   Some wallets might use automated bots to buy super early, which means you won’t be able to copy them effectively due to timing and speed differences.
2. **Monitor Profit and Loss:**
   Keep an eye on each wallet’s profit and loss history. Even top wallets can have losing streaks, and avoiding these can save you from heavy losses.
