![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/1*ERbwhj3Zb0pP-ID_peGZWw.png)

Copy trading is exactly what it sounds like.

You mimic the trading actions of others — automatically.

Find a profitable trader, plug into their moves, and let your account mirror their trades.

It’s popular in the Solana crypto space, especially for tracking meme coin traders.

But let’s cut to the chase: You still need to pick the right wallets and strategies to make this work.

## Why Solana for Copy Trading?

**Speed and low costs.**

Solana’s blockchain offers fast transaction times and minimal fees, making it perfect for copy trading strategies. Whether you’re diving into meme coins or chasing 100x trades, the network ensures you’re not burned by transaction costs.

Many skilled traders are active on Solana, offering plenty of wallets to follow. From whales scooping up meme coins to insiders with a knack for early entries, the opportunities are endless.

**3. Check wallets manually:**

* Focus on consistent performers with multiple
  **Unique Tokens**
  rather than one-hit wonders.
* Avoid those with low
  **Average Trade Time**
  as they are mostly snipers.
* Filter by
  **Alpha Wallets**
  to find the top traders.

## How to Spot Winning Wallets

Not all wallets are created equal. Some are traps; others are gold mines.

Here’s a cheat sheet for spotting the winners:

* **High ROI (over 100%):**
  Indicates consistent profitability.
* **Balanced trading frequency**
  : Avoid wallets with 50+ trades per day; they might just be farming activity or sniping.
* **Clear patterns**
  : Look for wallets that enter trades at logical points (not just random pumps).

You can check that on
[**BullX Neo**](https://t.me/BullxNeoBot)
.

— Go to Wallet tracker > Add the wallet address and a name.

— Click on a meme coin to open its chart and see the wallet’s behavior directly on the chart.

* **Minimal sniping**
  : Too many fast trades suggest risky behavior that’s hard to replicate.

## TradeWiz Copy Trading Settings

Once you’ve got a wallet to follow, open
[**TradeWiz on Telegram**](https://t.me/TradeWiz_Solbot?start=r-76ELPI3NAP)
and go to the
**Copy Trade**
section.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/1*CwdqaVztGXvBJKG1Q3qMVQ.png)

These are the settings to tweak:

* **Buy percentage**
  : Start small, around 10–20% of the trader’s position size.
* **Slippage**
  : Set between 20–50% depending on volatility.
* **Gas fees**
  : Use at least 0.02 SOL for priority execution.
* **Market cap filters**
  :

— Minimum: 10,000.

— Maximum: 500,000 (for meme coins).

* **Take profit**
  : Auto-sell at 300–500% to secure gains.
* **Stop-loss**
  : If the wallet misses an exit, cut your losses at 30%.

Don’t forget to click on
**+Create**
to finish the setup.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Blindly trusting a high win rate.**

* A 90% win rate doesn’t mean much if the wallet only trades tiny tokens with no liquidity.

**2. Skipping research.**

* Always check the wallet’s history. Are their profits coming from consistent trades or one lucky bet?

**3. Ignoring slippage.**

* High-volatility tokens can burn you if your slippage settings aren’t dialed in.

**4. Over investing.**

* Never put more than you can afford to lose. Start small, scale up once you see results.

## How Copy Trading Solana Meme Coins Can Make You Money

Meme coins thrive on hype, and Solana traders know how to ride the wave.
