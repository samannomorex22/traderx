Pump.fun meme coins are typically low-cap market tokens launched on platforms like Pump.fun. These coins often gain massive attention and generate hype through social media or community-driven promotions.

Some trend briefly, earning traders quick profits, while others crash just as fast, often due to scams or poor fundamentals. Understanding how these coins work and what drives their movement is crucial before trading.

## Tools You’ll Need for Trading

Before diving in, you’ll need a few tools to help you assess and trade these coins effectively. Here are the top recommendations:

   : Trading platforms that offer advanced tracking and filtering features, such as holder distribution and wallet connections.
2. **Pump Vision**
   : A tool within
   [BullX](https://t.me/BullxBetaBot)
   that categorizes meme coins into three stages:

* Newly created
* Approaching bonding (around $100,000 market cap)
* Graduated (fully bonded, often gaining more attention).

## Step 1: Spotting Meme Coin Launches

Start by heading to
[**BullX**](https://t.me/BullxBetaBot)

and filtering coins by creation time. Look for tokens with low market caps that are gaining traction. Once you find an interesting project, examine its bonding progress.

Coins nearing $100,000 in market cap are typically on the verge of being fully bonded, attracting more eyes and potentially becoming “real” meme coins.

## Step 2: Analyzing Holder Distribution

Holder distribution is a key indicator of a coin’s legitimacy. Use tools like BullX to examine the percentage of tokens held by top wallets.

Avoid coins where a single wallet (excluding liquidity pools) holds a disproportionate share, as this increases the likelihood of a rug pull.

## Step 3: Identifying Red Flags

Stay alert for the following warning signs:

* **Sniper Buys**
  : When multiple wallets purchase large amounts simultaneously during a launch, it’s often a coordinated scam.

* **Artificial Pumping**
  : Look for unnatural chart patterns where the price shoots up rapidly without organic buying and selling.

* **Bundled Supply**
  : Use the

  to detect wallets buying in bulk at the same timestamp — a clear sign of manipulation.

## Step 4: Evaluating Community and Social Media

A successful meme coin requires a strong community and active social media presence. Check for:

* **Twitter Activity**
  : Engaging posts, memes, and announcements.

* **Community Takeover (CTO)**
  : If the original developer is inactive, a community-led effort can indicate long-term potential.
* **Dex Screener Listings**
  : Coins that invest in adding social links to their Dex Screener profiles often have more committed communities.

## Step 5: Trading Strategies

## Entering Trades

* Set your slippage tolerance between 15% and 20% to account for rapid price changes.

* Always buy and sell manually to maintain control over your trades.

## Exiting Trades

* Take profits at key resistance levels, such as previous highs or round-number targets.
* Leave a “moon bag” (a small portion of your holdings) if the coin shows strong upward momentum.

## Step 6: Managing Risk

* **Start Small**
  : Begin with minimal investments and scale up as you gain experience.
* **Accept Losses**
  : Losses are part of the learning process, especially in the meme coin market. Focus on overall profitability rather than individual trades.
* **Avoid FOMO**
  : Never chase a coin that’s already skyrocketed. Wait for pullbacks and confirm higher lows before entering.
