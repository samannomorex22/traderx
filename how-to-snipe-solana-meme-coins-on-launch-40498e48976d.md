## Finding Safe Opportunities:

* Seek coins with low SOL in LP, burned LP on launch, low top 10 holder percentage, and disabled mint authority.
* These criteria reduce the risk of immediate rug pulls, though caution is still advised.

## Risk Management:

* Only invest amounts you‚Äôre willing to lose, typically between 0.05 and 0.2 SOL per position.
* While gains can be significant, the risk of being rugged is ever-present.

## Using Trojan Bot:

* Set your preferred settings, such as buy/sell slippage, tip SOL amounts.
* Input the coin‚Äôs CA (contract address) obtained from
