Once you have the app installed, it’s time to set up your account. You’ll notice that Moonshot is very user-friendly and feels a lot like other popular apps, such as Robinhood, but tailored specifically for meme coins.

## Step 3: Deposit Funds

Moonshot allows you to fund your account with Apple Pay, PayPal, or even your credit card. If you’re already familiar with Solana, you can also deposit SOL directly. This makes it incredibly flexible and accessible for both newcomers and experienced crypto users alike.

Deposit on Moonshot

You don’t need to make a big upfront deposit either. Just pay directly for the meme coin you want to buy. This way, you can limit your risk by only spending what you’re comfortable with. Remember, while trading meme coins can be exciting, it’s still crypto, and there’s always risk involved.

## Step 4: Browse Meme Coins

Now that you’re set up, you can start browsing the available meme coins in the app. Moonshot features a wide variety of meme coins that you might not find on larger exchanges. Some recent additions have even delivered huge returns, like MOONDENG, which saw a 75x increase!
