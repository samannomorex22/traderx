## Setting Up the AI Sniper Bot

The AI Sniper feature of AutoSnipe helps you identify and trade profitable tokens. You can customize different campaigns based on your risk tolerance, trading strategy, and preferences.

Here’s a simple guide on how to create and manage your sniper campaigns:

1. **Create Your Campaigns**
   : Think of each AI bot setup as a campaign. You can have multiple campaigns running simultaneously, each tailored to different strategies. For example, you can set one campaign for safe trades with conservative settings and another for riskier trades with higher rewards.

**2. Customize Your Campaign Settings**
:

* **Safe Campaign**
  : Set your bot to only buy tokens with a minimum liquidity, low holder concentration, and ensure liquidity is locked or burnt. You can set stop losses and profit-taking thresholds to manage your risk effectively.

* **Risky Campaign**
  : For those willing to take more risks, you can set broader criteria, allowing the bot to buy a wide range of tokens, including those with minimal liquidity checks.

* **Crazy Campaign**
  : If you’re feeling adventurous, set a campaign with almost no safety checks — these are for high-risk plays where the bot buys almost any token.

**3. Define Buy and Sell Rules**
: For each campaign, decide how much the bot should buy per trade, set your stop loss percentages, and determine your profit targets. For example, you might set the bot to sell half of your holdings at 50% profit and the rest at 100% profit.

**4. Activate Your Sniper Bot**
: Once you’ve set up your campaigns, activate them. The bot will run in the background, buying and selling according to your specified rules.

## Copy Trading Feature

One of AutoSnipe’s standout features is its Copy Trading function. This feature lets you replicate the trades of successful wallets automatically.

Here’s how to set it up:

1. **Identify Profitable Wallets**
   : Look for top traders in the Solana community, analyze their performance, and decide which wallets to copy. Be mindful that some wallets may belong to bots, so choose carefully.

**2. Set Copy Trade Parameters**
: Decide how much you want to invest in each trade relative to the original wallet’s trades. You can either match their trade amount or set a percentage.

**3. Monitor Performance**
: Keep an eye on the wallets you’re copying. If they consistently perform well, keep them active; if not, you can easily deactivate them with a click.

## Monitoring and Adjusting Your Campaigns

Once your bot is running, you need to regularly monitor its performance. Some campaigns may not perform as expected due to market conditions, so be prepared to adjust stop losses, profit targets, or even pause campaigns that aren’t meeting your expectations.

Remember, trading bots aren’t set-and-forget tools. You must keep refining your strategies based on market feedback and the performance of each campaign. You can always experiment with different settings to find the best strategy that works for you.
