Right in front of you are some of the most profitable wallets on Solana right now. For example, one wallet has $3 million in trading volume with an impressive 72% win rate. Another wallet shows $7 million in volume with a solid 64% win rate. The goal is to find wallets that consistently perform with over 50% win rates. This ensures that, even after fees, you remain in profit.

## Step 2: Analyze Wallet Activity

Before jumping into copy trading, it’s important to verify that these wallets are still active.

Head over to

to analyze the wallet’s recent activity.

Look for recurring early purchases without quick sell-offs, as this might suggest strong long-term belief in the project.

Make things even easier by utilizing the

## Step 3: Set Up Copy Trading

To start copying trades, use a tool like Trojan.

Make sure the settings are set to “Simple Mode” to enable the copy trade feature.

From here, you can access the copy trade feature and enter the target wallet’s address! For easy tracking, label the wallet by its win rate and trading volume, like “81% — $11M.”

You can choose how much to trade by either copying a percentage of what the wallet buys or setting a fixed amount. A good starting point is to test small trades, for instance, 0.1 SOL, to see how it performs.

It’s also wise to set it up so it only buys once per trade, allowing you to gauge profitability without getting too deep too quickly.

## Step 4: Fine-Tune Your Copy Trade Settings

There are a few advanced settings you can adjust to improve your copy trading:

* **Gas Settings**
  : If you want to prioritize your transactions over others, increase the gas fee. However, this will cost you more SOL.
* **Exclude PumpFun Tokens**
  : If you don’t want to be caught up in risky trades, consider excluding wallets that focus on PumpFun strategies.
* **Liquidity & Market Cap Filters**
  : To avoid small, illiquid tokens, set a minimum market cap of $100K. This ensures you’re copying trades on safer, higher-volume tokens.

## Step 5: Monitor Your Copy Trading Performance

Once the copy trade is active, you can sit back and let it run. However, it’s essential to regularly check the wallet’s performance. Sometimes, wallets that start strong can become less profitable over time. If this happens, remove the wallet and find a new one to copy.

Avoid wallets that have random or outdated trades. For example, if a wallet last traded three months ago with just one token, it’s likely not a good candidate for copy trading. Stick to wallets that show regular, successful trading patterns.

## Step 6: Test and Adjust

The key to success with copy trading is testing different wallets and adjusting your strategy. Spend at least a few minutes reviewing each wallet’s trading history before committing your funds. Look for steady profits and avoid wallets that rely on quick pump-and-dump tactics.

In the example above, the wallet made a small but consistent profit by buying and selling quickly, without holding too long or using a bot. This is the kind of wallet you want to follow for safe gains.
