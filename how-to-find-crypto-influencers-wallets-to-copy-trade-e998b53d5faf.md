Find Crypto Wallets To Copy Trade

Are you keen on making smart moves in the crypto market but not sure where to start? Well, you’re in luck! In this guide, we’ll walk you through the process of finding crypto influencers’ wallets to copy trade, or simply to track their moves for potential gains.

Let’s dive in!

## Create An Account On X (Twitter)

To begin, you’ll need an X (Twitter) account.

If you’re unsure where to find crypto influencers to follow, start by checking out recommendations from others in the space. The more influencers you follow, the better your chances of discovering valuable insights and profitable wallets.

## Explore Recommendations

Once you’ve followed a decent number of influencers, keep an eye on your feed for suggestions of new accounts to follow. Look out for posts showcasing gains, as these are indicators of potentially profitable wallets. Even if you don’t know the person posting, their success speaks volumes.

## Identify Target Wallets

When you spot a promising post, take note of the tokens mentioned. In the example provided, the user mentioned a token called “Pedro.” With this information, head over to
[**Dex Screener**](https://dexscreener.com/)
or similar platforms and search for the token. This will lead you to the contract address and other details.

. Look for the user who matches the token amount mentioned in the post. Once you’ve found them, you can confirm their wallet by cross-referencing the tokens and amounts listed in their profile.
