When using Pump Vision, focus on the
**“graduated”**
section, which features tokens that are past their initial listing phase but still under the radar. These tokens often have the best mix of stability and growth potential, avoiding the chaos of brand-new launches.

## How to Use Filters for Better Results

Filters are essential for narrowing down your search.

Here are the key metrics you should focus on:

1. **Developer Holdings**
   : Look for developers holding less than 10% of the token to reduce the risk of rug pulls.
2. **Holders**
   : Target tokens with 100–500 unique holders. This range indicates community interest without being over saturated.
3. **Liquidity**
   : Opt for tokens with liquidity between $20,000 and $150,000. This ensures smoother trading while avoiding extreme price swings.
4. **Volume**
   : Focus on tokens with daily trading volumes between $10,000 and $250,000. Higher volume often means stronger market interest.
5. **Market Cap**
   : Look for market caps between $50,000 and $150,000 for tokens with room to grow.

filters will help you find tokens that are both undervalued and stable enough to trade.

## Spotting Tokens with Strong Narratives

To succeed in meme coin trading, you need to understand
**narratives**
. Narratives are the themes driving hype in the market, like AI, mascots, or trending events. For example, during ChatGPT’s anniversary, AI-related tokens often see a spike in interest.

Here’s how to find trending narratives:

* Use the
  **Explore**
  section of BullX to see tokens trending over 24 hours.

* Look for patterns in token names or themes. For example, dog or cat mascots often perform well.

* Pay attention to upcoming events, such as anniversaries or market news, that could fuel demand.

## Daily Routine for Consistent Gains

To make $100/day, consistency is key.

Here’s a simple routine to follow:

1. **Check Trends Daily**
   : Log in to Pump Vision and Explore to see what’s trending and gaining traction.
2. **Apply Filters**
   : Use the filters discussed earlier to narrow down tokens worth investing in.
3. **Research Tokens**
   : Investigate the Twitter profiles, community activity, and development teams behind the tokens. Look for active engagement and strong narratives.
4. **Identify Hidden Gems**
   : Focus on tokens 2–5 days old with solid market activity but still flying under the radar.

By sticking to this routine, you’ll stay ahead of the crowd and consistently find profitable opportunities.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Even experienced traders make mistakes.

Here are a few pitfalls to watch out for:

1. **FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)**
   : Avoid chasing tokens that have already pumped significantly. Instead, look for opportunities early.
2. **Ignoring Liquidity**
   : Tokens with very low liquidity can trap you in trades or lead to extreme price swings.
3. **Overlooking Narratives**
   : Always align your trades with current or upcoming trends to maximize potential gains.

## Turning Losses into Wins

* **Track Your Trades**

* **Adjust Strategies**
  : If a particular approach isn’t working, tweak your filters or focus on different narratives.
* **Be Patient**
